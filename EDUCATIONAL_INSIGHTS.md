# IPEDS Higher Education Landscape Dashboard

## üìö Project Overview
Interactive Tableau dashboard providing comprehensive analysis of the U.S. higher education landscape using IPEDS (Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System) data. The dashboard examines enrollment patterns, graduation rates, institutional performance, and regional demographic diversity across American higher education institutions.

## üéØ Educational Context
This analysis covers critical metrics in higher education including **8.80M applicants**, **1.44M enrolled students**, **1.64M bachelor's degrees awarded**, and **78.2K doctoral degrees** across multiple regions and institution types. The dashboard serves as a strategic tool for understanding educational access, completion rates, and demographic representation in U.S. higher education.

## üìä Key Educational Metrics

### Enrollment & Access Analysis
- **Total Applicants**: 8.80M (baseline demand for higher education)
- **Estimated Enrollment**: 10.77M (total student population)
- **Total Enrolled**: 1.44M (new student cohort)
- **Admission Yield**: 45.5K (enrollment conversion rate)
- **Enrollment Rate**: 16.4% (applicants to enrolled conversion)

### Completion & Success Metrics
- **Bachelor's Degrees**: 1.64M awarded annually
- **Doctoral Degrees**: 78.2K advanced degrees
- **Certificates**: 7.5K professional certifications
- **Degree Completion Rate**: 15.2% (bachelor's degrees vs. total enrollment)

### Regional Performance Leaders
- **Southeast**: 361K students (highest regional enrollment)
- **Mid East**: 259K students (strong educational presence)
- **Great Lakes**: 236K students (established education corridor)

## üí° Key Educational Insights & Policy Implications

### 1. Regional Educational Equity
**Finding**: Significant enrollment disparities between regions (Southeast: 361K vs. Rocky Mountains: 55K)

**Policy Implications**:
- **Educational Access**: Lower enrollment regions may indicate barriers to higher education access
- **Resource Allocation**: Federal and state funding may need geographic rebalancing
- **Economic Development**: Regions with lower enrollment may face long-term economic challenges

### 2. Enrollment Conversion Challenges
**Finding**: Only 16.4% of applicants actually enroll, indicating significant barriers

**Strategic Recommendations**:
- **Financial Aid Enhancement**: Address affordability barriers through expanded aid programs
- **Application Process Optimization**: Streamline admissions procedures
- **Regional Outreach**: Targeted recruitment in underrepresented areas
- **Alternative Pathways**: Develop community college transfer programs

### 3. Graduation Timeline Realities
**Finding**: Substantial improvement in graduation rates when extending timeline from 4 to 6 years

**Educational Insights**:
- **Support Systems**: Need for enhanced academic and financial support services
- **Part-time Options**: Growing demand for flexible degree completion paths
- **Remedial Education**: Importance of academic preparation programs
- **Work-Study Balance**: Recognition of students' economic realities

### 4. Institutional Concentration Effects
**Finding**: Top institution has 60% more enrollment than 10th-ranked institution

**Market Analysis**:
- **Competitive Advantage**: Elite institutions maintaining dominant market positions
- **Access Distribution**: Potential inequities in access to high-quality education
- **Capacity Planning**: Need for strategic enrollment management across institutions

### 5. Demographic Representation Patterns
**Finding**: Significant regional variation in multi-racial student representation and unreported demographics

**Diversity Implications**:
- **Inclusive Practices**: Need for consistent demographic data collection methods
- **Regional Outreach**: Targeted diversity recruitment in underrepresented regions
- **Cultural Competency**: Institution-specific diversity and inclusion programming
